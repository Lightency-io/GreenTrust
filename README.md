## Overview

Lightency's GreenTrust is pioneering a transformation in the green energy sector with its On-Chain Energy Certification Platform. Utilizing blockchain technology, this platform revolutionizes the traditional energy certification process by offering a more secure, transparent, and decentralized approach. Our solution addresses the limitations of current systems by ensuring that all energy certifications are tamper-proof, transparent, and readily accessible, enhancing trust in the green energy markets.

---

## Objectives

Our primary objective is to transition from traditional, manual certification processes to a fully automated, on-chain system on the Aptos blockchain. This transition aims to provide a more reliable, transparent, and immutable method of certifying renewable energy production and consumption.

---

## Key Features

1. **On-Chain Certification Process**
    - The entire certification lifecycle, including application, processing, and issuance, is managed on the Aptos blockchain.
2. **Decentralized Data Verification**
    - Data verification employs a decentralized model, enhancing security and reliability of the certification process.
3. **Minting of On-Chain Certificates**
    - Certifications that successfully pass the data compatibility check are minted as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the blockchain, representing digital proof of renewable energy certification.
4. **Automated Data Filtering and Export**
    - Demand agents upload data, which is then automatically processed by our platform to filter, verify, and validate the information before issuing certificates.

---

## Impact

This project addresses key challenges in the renewable energy sector, such as the inefficiency and lack of transparency in the certification process. By transitioning to an on-chain model, we aim to reduce costs, improve data integrity, and provide a more accessible and trustworthy certification system.
